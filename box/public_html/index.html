        <h1>Time to Degree Across PhD Disciplines</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Time to Degree is calculated from the first semester the individual is enrolled as either a Masters or PhD student in the program they get their degree in.</li>
            <li>Time to Degree was counted in years.</li>
            <li>Time to Degree is calculated using the graduation date as the completion date.</li>
            <li>In cases where a student changed programs, if the credits taken in the first program counted towards their degree progress in their final degree program, then the time they were in the first program is included in their time to degree.</li>
            <li>Median time to degree is calculated based on the graduating cohort.</li>
        </ul>  
       
        <p>On these pages, time to degree is presented in two different ways: Median time to degree is presented over time and the distribution of time to degree within a given time period.</p>
